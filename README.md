# Automation of Ms. PAC-MAN using Reinforcement Learning

This repository showcases the automation of Ms. PAC-MAN using Reinforcement Learning with a Deep Q-Network (DQN). The agent learns to play the game by training on the Ms. PAC-MAN environment provided by OpenAI Gym.

## Requirements
Ensure you have the necessary libraries installed:

```bash
pip install gym
pip install tensorflow
pip install matplotlib
```

## Usage

1. **Clone Repository:**
   
   git clone [[https://github.com/your-username/mspacman-reinforcement-learning.git](https://github.com/nagajavisetty/Automation-of-PACMAN-using-reinforcement-learning)](https://github.com/nagajavisetty/Automation-of-PACMAN-using-reinforcement-learning.git)

2. **Run the Code:**
   Execute the provided Python script:

3. **Visualize Gameplay:**
   Open the generated animation to visualize the trained agent's gameplay.

4. **View Performance Video:**
   For a demonstration of the agent achieving a perfect score, watch the embedded video below:

5. **Customization:**
   - Adjust hyperparameters and configurations in the training section based on your requirements.
   - Customize the training loop and testing steps for different scenarios.

6. **Close Environment:**
   Make sure to close the environment after running the script:
   ```bash
   env.close()
   ```

## Notes
- The codebase can be extended and modified to suit specific needs.
- Verify that the Ms. PAC-MAN environment is supported and correctly installed.
- Feel free to explore, modify, and contribute to enhance the reinforcement learning experience.

Happy coding and enjoy watching your agent achieve a perfect score in Ms. PAC-MAN! üïπÔ∏èüöÄ
